<h2>GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4)</h2>

<p>
The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) is an estimate of global surface temperature change.
Graphs and tables are updated around the middle of every month using current data files from <b>NOAA GHCN
v4</b> (meteorological stations), and <b>ERSST v5</b> (ocean areas), combined as
described in our publications
<a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/references.html">Hansen et al. (2010)</a> and
<a href="https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/le05800h.html">Lenssen et al. (2019)</a>.
These updated files incorporate reports for the previous month and also late reports
and corrections for earlier months.
</p>

<p>
We will continue to also provide <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/index_v3.html">GISTEMP v3, our analysis based on the <b>GHCN v3/SCAR</b></a> reports for the time being.
</p>

<h3>News and Updates</h3>

<p><b>July 15, 2019:</b>
The difference between raw data and the unadjusted data has been clarified on our <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/index.html#q206">FAQ site</a>. But note that the GISS analysis currently uses the <b><i>adjusted</i></b> GHCN v4 data.</p>

<p><b>June 14, 2019:</b>
Starting with this release of our monthly analysis, the GISS temperature analysis, GISTEMP v4, is now based on <b>GHCN v4</b> for station reports; ocean temperatures are still based on ERSST v5.</p>

<p> Some of our graphics will provide an uncertainty domain for the estimates obtained from our analysis.</p>

<p>We will no longer provide the legacy global estimates based on surface air temperatures alone, since they are overestimating any changes (heating or cooling) and are often confused with temperatures averaged over the land surface only — land surface means are still provided in the "Annual Mean Temperature Change over Land and Ocean" section of the <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v4/">graphs web page</a>.</p> 

<p><b>May 23, 2019:</b>
NASA has posted <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20190523/">a feature story</a> about the new GISTEMP <b><a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/uncertainty/">uncertainty quantification</a></b>.</p>


<p><b>May 16, 2019:</b>
A <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data_v4_globe/"><b>globe version of the station locator</b></a> was built that handles the increase in the number of stations efficiently for most browsers. This option is added as an alternative to the leaflet version with its Mercator projection (and the need to move a station off the South pole to make it accessible).
</p>
<p> The <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v4/customize.html">custom plotter</a> was redesigned. The default smoothing was changed to using a 30-year window so that it better indicates the climate change, 30 years being the standard period to define the climate.
</p>




<!--
<p><b>Feb. 15, 2019:</b>
The forthcoming version GISTEMP v4 using <b>GHCN v4</b> and ERSST v5 was made available as a beta release.
</p>

<p><b>Feb. 6, 2019:</b>
Temperature anomaly data for 2018 have been posted. NASA posted a <href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20190206/">news release</a> about the GISS year 2018 temperature analysis. That analysis is still based on GISTEMP v3.</p>

<h3>Background of the GISS Analysis</h3>

<p>
The basic GISS temperature analysis scheme was defined in the late 1970s by James Hansen when a method
of estimating global temperature change was needed for comparison with one-dimensional global climate
models. The scheme was based on the finding that the correlation of temperature change was reasonably
strong for stations separated by up to 1200 km, especially at middle and high latitudes. This fact
proved sufficient to obtain useful estimates for global mean temperature changes.
</p>

<p>
Temperature analyses were carried out prior to 1980, notably those of Murray Mitchell, but most covered
only 20-90°N latitudes. Our first published results (<a href="https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha04600x.html">Hansen et al. 1981</a>) showed that, contrary to
impressions from northern latitudes, global cooling after 1940 was small, and there was net global
warming of about 0.4°C between the 1880s and 1970s.
</p>

<p>
The early analysis scheme went through a series of enhancements that are listed and illustrated on the
<a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/history"><b>History Page</b></a>.
</p>

<h4>Documentation and Assessment of Results</h4>

<p>
The analysis method was fully documented in <a href="https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha00700d.html">Hansen
and Lebedeff (1987)</a>, including quantitative estimates of the error in annual and 5-year mean
temperature change. This was done by sampling at station locations a spatially complete data set of a
long run of a global climate model, which was shown to have realistic spatial and temporal variability.
This however only addresses the error due to incomplete spatial coverage of measurements. A more complete
uncertainty analysis was published recently and forms the core of the <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/uncertainty">Uncertainty website</a>.
</p>

<p>
As there are other potential sources of error, such as urban warming near meteorological stations, many
other methods have been used to verify the approximate magnitude of inferred global warming. These
methods include inference of surface temperature change from vertical temperature profiles in the ground
(bore holes) at many sites around the world, rate of glacier retreat at many locations, and studies by
several groups of the effect of urban and other local human influences on the global temperature record.
All of these yield consistent estimates of the approximate magnitude of global warming, which reached
about 0.8°C in 2010, twice the magnitude reported in 1981.
</p>

<p>
Further affirmation of the reality of the warming is its spatial distribution, which has largest values
at locations remote from any local human influence, with a global pattern consistent with that expected
for response to global climate forcings (larger in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere,
larger at high latitudes than low latitudes, larger over land than over ocean).
</p>

<p>
An updated documentation (<a href="https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha00510u.html">Hansen et al. 2010</a>)
compares alternative analyses and addresses questions about perception and reality of global warming;
various choices for the ocean data are tested; it is also shown that global temperature change is
sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions, where observations are limited. A multi-year
smoothing is applied to fully remove the annual cycle and improve information content in temperature
graphs. Despite large year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Niño-La Niña cycle of
tropical ocean temperature, the conclusion could be made that global temperature continued to rise
rapidly in the 21st century, new record heights being reached in every decade.
</p>

<h4 id="UrbAdj">GISS Homogenization (Urban Adjustment)</h4>

<p>
One of the improvements — introduced in 1998 — was the implementation of a method to address
the problem of urban warming: The urban and peri-urban (i.e., other than rural) stations are adjusted so
that their long-term trend matches that of the mean of neighboring rural stations. Urban stations
without nearby rural stations are dropped. This preserves local short-term variability without affecting
long term trends. Originally, the classification of stations was based on population size near that
station; the <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/sources_v4/gistemp.html"><b>current analysis</b></a> uses satellite-observed night
lights to determine which stations are located in urban and peri-urban areas.
</p>

<h4>Monthly Updates</h4>

<p>Graphs and tables are updated around the middle of every month using the current adjusted GHCN
data. The new file incorporates reports for the previous month as well as late reports and corrections
for earlier months.</p>

<p>We maintain a running record of any modifications made to the analysis on our <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/updates_v4/"><b>Updates to Analysis</b></a> page. </p>

<!--
<p><b>Note: LOTI</b> provides a more realistic representation of the global mean trends than
<b>dT<sub>s</sub></b> below;
it slightly underestimates warming or cooling trends, since the much larger heat capacity of water
compared to air causes a slower and diminished reaction to changes; <b>dT<sub>s</sub></b> on the other hand
overestimates trends, since it disregards most of the dampening effects of the oceans that cover about two thirds of the Earth's surface.
